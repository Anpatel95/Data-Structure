# Data Structure Projects Repository

This repository contains implementations of various data structure projects aimed at exploring and understanding different concepts in computer science. Each project demonstrates unique data structure techniques and algorithms. Below is an overview of each project.

## 1. Binary Tree - Drawing Binary Tree Using Various Numeric Expressions

This project involves visualizing a binary tree structure based on different numeric expressions. It demonstrates how binary trees can be created, manipulated, and displayed in a graphical format. The primary objectives include:

- Implementing different numeric expressions to build and display binary trees.
- Exploring traversal methods (e.g., pre-order, in-order, post-order) to navigate and visualize the tree.
- Using graphical libraries to create visual representations of the tree for better understanding.

## 2. Grocery Store Queue Management

This project simulates a grocery store's checkout system using multiple queue management methods to evaluate and compare customer service times. The simulation considers different queuing strategies to find the most efficient way to serve customers. The following options are implemented.

- Option 1: Single queue with 5 counters — A single line where customers are distributed among 5 counters.
- Option 2: Round Robin Queue Policy — Customers are assigned to the counters in a rotating manner.
- Option 3: Shortest Queue Policy — Customers join the queue with the fewest people waiting.
- Option 4: Random Queue — Customers are randomly assigned to any queue.

### Objectives

- Implementing multiple queue management strategies.
- Measuring and comparing service times for each strategy.
- Analyzing the efficiency of different queuing methods.

## 3. Transitive Closure Graph

This project involves computing the transitive closure of a directed graph using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm. Transitive closure is a key concept in graph theory, representing which vertices are reachable from one another.

### Objectives

- Understanding and implementing the Floyd-Warshall algorithm for transitive closure.
- Analyzing the reachability of different vertices within a graph.
- Visualizing the graph to show connections and reachability.
